# _The_ bgsulz Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/bgsulz/bgsulz-Bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bgsulz/bgsulz-Bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/bgsulz/bgsulz-Bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bgsulz/bgsulz-Bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

My personal Scoop bucket. If you don't know what that is: [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) is a positively heavenly package manager for Windows that avoids PATH pollution and tries its best to install everything portably. A bucket is, in layman's terms, just a bunch of instructions for Scoop that tells it how to install different programs from around the internet.

## What's in it?

Nothing! But soon -- probably sooner than I remember to update this --
- FlexASIO
- FlexASIO GUI
- Haali/Matroska Media Splitter

## Can I use it?

Knock yourself out! But remain aware that I made this for my personal use, so please don't expect any support or maintenance! Sorry!
